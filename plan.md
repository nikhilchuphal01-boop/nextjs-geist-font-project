# Detailed Plan for Raja Pathan Barber Shop Website

## Overview
Create a modern, responsive, and stylistic website for Raja Pathanâ€™s barber shop using the existing Next.js 15+ boilerplate with TypeScript, shadcn/ui components, Radix UI primitives, and Tailwind CSS. The website will be clean, professional, and accessible, focusing on typography, colors, spacing, and layout without using any icon libraries or external images.

## UI/UX Considerations

- Use Tailwind CSS custom variables for consistent theming (dark/light mode support).
- Responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Accessibility-first approach using Radix UI primitives.
- Clean typography hierarchy with headings, subheadings, and body text.
- Use spacing and layout to create a modern, airy feel.
- Use buttons and form inputs from shadcn/ui components for consistency.
- Avoid any icon libraries or external images; use only typography and colors for visual hierarchy.
- Use placeholder images with descriptive alt text for gallery and hero sections.

## Error Handling and Best Practices

- Form validation with React Hook Form to prevent invalid submissions.
- Graceful fallback for images using `onerror` attribute to handle loading failures.
- Use try-catch or error boundaries if any async operations are added later.
- Accessibility: Use semantic HTML elements and ARIA attributes where appropriate.
- Responsive design tested on multiple screen sizes.
- Use TypeScript types and interfaces for props and state management.
- Use consistent naming conventions and folder structure.

---

## Integration with Existing Codebase

- Leverage existing UI components from `src/components/ui/` for buttons, inputs, cards, and toast notifications.
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes and custom variables for styling.
- Use React Hook Form for form management as per existing dependencies.
- No external API or backend integration required initially; form submission can be mocked or extended later.
- Maintain the existing project structure and coding standards.

## Placeholder Images Example

```tsx
const heroImage = "https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Barber+Shop+Modern+Interior+with+Barber+Chair+and+Tools";
const galleryImage1 = "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Barber+cutting+hair+in+modern+shop";
const galleryImage2 = "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Close+up+of+beard+trim+service";
const galleryImage3 = "https://placehold.co/400x300?text=Barber+shop+waiting+area+with+chairs";

<img
  src={heroImage}
  alt="Modern barber shop interior with barber chair and tools arranged neatly"
  onError={(e) => { e.currentTarget.src = "https://placehold.co/1920x1080?text=Image+not+available"; }}
/>
```
